*** Last Mile for Workshop Proposals Submission ***

The Annual ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2026)

March 23-26, 2026, 5* Coral Beach Hotel & Resort, Paphos, Cyprus

https://iui.hosting.acm.org/2026/

(*** Submission Deadline: August 29, 2025 (extended and final!) ***)


We are pleased to invite proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction
with the Annual International ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI
2026), Paphos, Cyprus.

Workshops aim to provide a venue for presenting research on emerging or specialized
topics of interest and to offer an informal forum for discussing research questions and
challenges. Potential workshop topics should be related to the general theme of the
conference (“Where HCI meets AI”).

We welcome proposals for a wide range of *full-day* or *half-day* workshops, including
but not limited to:

• Mini Conferences: Workshops that focus on a specific topic and may have their own
paper submission and review processes.

• Interactive Formats: Workshops that encourage active participation and hands-on
experiences through break-out sessions or group work to explore specific topics. They
may have their own paper submission and review process or target a report summarizing
the discussions and outcomes.

• Emerging Work Sessions: Workshops that foster discussion around emerging ideas.
Organizers may raise specific topics and invite position papers, late-breaking results, or
extended abstracts.

• Project-Centric Formats: Workshops tied closely to a specific existing large-scale
funded project(e.g., NSF, EU) with the goal to engage a broader community.

• Interactive Competitions: Formats that invite individuals and teams to participate in
challenges or hackathons on selected topics relevant to IUI.


Review and Oversight by Workshop Chairs

Proposals will be reviewed and evaluated by the Workshop Chairs. It is possible that
workshops may be cancelled, shortened, merged, or restructured if there are insufficient
submissions.

Workshop summaries will be included in the ACM Digital Library for ACM IUI 2026. We will
also publish joint workshop proceedings for accepted workshop submissions
(through CEUR or a similar venue).


Responsibilities of Workshop Organizers

• Coordinate the Call for Papers, including solicitation, submission handling, and peer
review process.

• Create and maintain a dedicated website with workshop information. The IUI 2026
website will link to this page.

• Prepare and communicate a Call for Participation, targeting both IUI and broader relevant
communities (e.g., via mailing lists, social media, newsgroups, or offline events).

• Facilitate the planned activities, including paper presentations, discussions, and/or
interactive elements.

• Submit a workshop summary for inclusion in the ACM Digital Library.

• Collect camera-ready papers and author agreements from workshop participants for the
joint workshop proceedings (CEUR or similar).

Note that for the joint proceedings (CEUR or similar), submissions should be peer-reviewed
and will need to meet publishers’ guidelines. CEUR, for example, requires a 5-page
minimum per contribution. Note that not all workshop formats listed above may meet
these requirements, and we may not be able to include them.

IUI 2026 is an in-person event, and we expect workshop organizers to attend, allowing the
workshop to be conducted on-site. One author per paper is expected to attend in person
to present the work.


Proposal Format

Workshop proposals should be a maximum of four pages long (single-column format).
Prepare your submission using the latest templates: Word Submission Template
(https://authors.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx),
or the LaTex Template
(https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex).
For Latex, please use “\documentclass[manuscript,review]{acmart}”.

The proposals should be organized as follows:

• Name and title: A one-word acronym and a full title. Please indicate “(Workshop)” after
the title.

• Abstract: A brief summary of the workshop.

• Description of workshop topic: Should discuss the relevance of the proposed topic to
IUI and its interest for the IUI 2026 audience. Include a concise discussion of why this
workshop is particularly relevant for the intended audience and how it will complement
and enhance topics covered at the main conference.

• Previous history: List of previous workshops on this topic, including the conferences
that hosted them and the number of participants. If available, report on past editions of
the workshop (including URLs), along with a brief statement of the workshop
series (e.g., covering topics, number of paper submissions, and participants), as well as
post-workshop publications over the years and acceptance statistics. If this is the first
edition of the workshop, describe how it differs from others on similar topics (e.g., by
including conference names and years).

• Organizer(s): Names, affiliations, emails, and web pages of the organizer(s). Provide a
brief description of the background of the organizer(s). Strong proposals normally include
organizers who bring differing perspectives on the topic and are actively connected to the
communities of potential participants. Please indicate the primary contact person and the
organizers who will attend the workshop. Also, please provide a list of other workshops
organized by workshop organizers in the past.

• Workshop program committee: Names and affiliation of the members of the (tentative)
workshop program committee that will evaluate the workshop submissions.

• Participants: Include a statement of how many participants you expect and how you plan
to invite participants for the workshop. If possible, include the names of at least 10 people
who have expressed interest in participating in the workshop or tutorial.

• Workshop activities: A brief description of the format regarding the mix of
events or activities, such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, demonstrations,
teaching activities, hands-on practical exercises, and general discussion.

• Planned outcomes of the workshop: What are you hoping to achieve by the end of the
workshop? Please list here any planned publications or other outcomes expected.

• Length: Full-day or half-day.


Submission Platform

• All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS 2.0
http://new.precisionconference.com/~sigchi by the proposal submission deadline.

and press "Go".

We encourage both researchers and industry practitioners to submit workshop proposals.
To support diverse perspectives in the workshops, we strongly recommend including
organizers from varied institutions and backgrounds.

Furthermore, we welcome workshops with an innovative structure that can attract diverse
types of contributions and foster valuable interactions.

Prospective organizers are encouraged to contact the Workshop Chairs in
advance (workshops2026@iui.acm.org) to discuss ideas, receive feedback, or seek
assistance in preparing engaging proposals. Especially for workshop proposals featuring
innovative interactive formats, we are happy to help further develop and implement the
ideas.
