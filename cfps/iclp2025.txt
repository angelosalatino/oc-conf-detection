Formal and operational semantics, Non-monotonic reasoning, Reasoning under uncertainty, Knowledge representation, Semantic issues of combining logic and neural models, Complexity results.
 
Language Design and Programming Methodologies:
Concurrency and parallelism, Mobility, Interacting with ML, Logic-based domain-specific languages, Hybrid logical and imperative/functional languages, Programming techniques, Theory reasoning, Answer set programming, Inductive logic programming, Coinductive logic programming.
 
Program Analysis and Optimization:
Analysis, Transformation, Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Visualization, Logic-based validation of generated programs.
 
Implementation Methodologies and Applications:
Compilation, Constraint implementation, Ethics and trustworthiness, Explainability, Parallel/distributed execution, Search and optimization problems, Heuristic methods, Logic-based prompt engineering, Tabling, User interfaces.
 
 
REGISTRATION
Early fees are available until July 30th AOE, the registration procedure closes August 30th AOE. On-Site Registration is not available.
