They provide a unique venue for exploring emerging ideas, discussing novel perspectives on established research, and engaging with related research communities. We encourage proposals for workshops that will inspire meaningful dialogue and collaboration among ISWC attendees, providing a platform to advance research and innovation in this dynamic field.

Important dates:
Submission deadline - February 18, 2025
Notification to proposers - March 11, 2025

Call for Dagstuhl Style Workshops

Inspired by the Special Session at ISWC 2024 and the Dagstuhl Seminar model, these workshops are designed to encourage in-depth discussions on challenges or emerging topics within a half-day or full-day event format. The goal is to create a collaborative and open environment for brainstorming and exploring new directions, similar to the spirit of Dagstuhl Seminars. These workshops will prioritize dynamic discussions and the presentation of fresh ideas and ongoing research, rather than requiring participants to submit papers or give formal presentations.

Important dates:
Submission deadline - July 1, 2025
Notification to proposers - July 11, 2025

Call for Doctoral Consortium Submissions

The DC event is intended for students who have articulated a reasonably detailed research proposal, preferably supported by some preliminary results, but are not yet on the final stretch of their thesis, such that the feedback gathered at the DC will have a maximal impact. The aim is to support the students in refining their proposal and to suggest possible ways to improve their research plan and to achieve results with prospective greater impact.

Submissions Due - 3 June 2025
