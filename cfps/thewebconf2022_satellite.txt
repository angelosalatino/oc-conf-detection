The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding the current state and the evolution of the Web through the lens of different disciplines, including computing, computational social science, economics and political sciences. The Posters and Demos Track is a forum to foster interactions among researchers and practitioners by allowing them to present and demonstrate their new and innovative work. In addition, the Posters and Demos track will give conference attendees an opportunity to learn novel on-going research projects through informal interactions. Demos submissions must be based on an implemented and tested system.
Posters and Demos papers will be peer-reviewed by members of the Poster Committee based on originality, significance, quality, and clarity. Accepted papers will appear in the Companion conference proceedings. In addition, accepted work authors will be asked to create a digital poster to present their work during the Posters and Demos track at the conference.

Submitted posters are expected to be aligned with one or more of the relevant topics of TheWebConf community, including (but not limited to):
 - Web-related Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets

The Web Conference 2022 Developer and W3C Track is part of The Web Conference 2022 in Lyon, France. Participation in the developers track will require registration of at least one author for the conference. The Web Conference 2022 Developer and W3C Track presents an opportunity to share the latest developments across the technical community, both in terms of technologies and in terms of tooling. We will be running as a regular track with live (preferred) or pre-recorded (as an alternative format) presentations during the conference, showcasing community expertise and progress. The event will take place according to the CET time zone (Paris time). We will do our best to accommodate speakers in as convenient as possible time slots for their local time zones.

While we are open to any contributions that are relevant for the Web space, here are a few areas that we are particularly interested in:
 - Tools and methodologies to measure and reduce the environmental impact of the Web.
 - New usage patterns enabled by Progressive Web Apps and new browser APIs.
 - Work-arounds, data-based quantification and identification of Web compatibility issues.
 - Web tooling and developer experience, in particular towards reducing the complexity for newcomers: How can we get closer to the magic of hitting "view source" as a way to get people started?
 - Tools and frameworks that enable the convergence of real-time communication and streaming media.
 - Decentralized architectures for the Web, such as those emerging from projects and movements such as Solid, or "Web3".
 - Peer to peer architectures and protocols.
 - Identity management (DID, WebAuthN, Federated Credential Management).

*Submission guidelines*
Submissions can take several form and authors can choose one or multiple submission entry among the following choices:
 - Papers: papers are limited to 6 pages, including references. Submissions are NOT anonymous. It is the authors’ responsibility to ensure that their submissions adhere strictly to the required format. In particular, the format cannot be modified with the objective of squeezing in more material. Papers will be published in the ACM The Web Conference Companion Proceedings archived by the ACM Digital Library, as open access, if the authors wish so.
 - Links to code repositories on GitHub (with sufficient description and documentation).
 - Links to recorded demos (as a complement to the above, ideally following established best practices as proposed by the W3C).
 - Any other resource reachable on the Web.
Submissions will be handled via Easychair, at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=thewebconf2022, selecting the Web Developer and W3C track.
